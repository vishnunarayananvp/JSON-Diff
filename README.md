# JSON-Diff
A utility to find difference between two jsons

Open the json-diff.html in a browser.

This utility compares two JSON objects, from text files provided, in two diferent modes : data mode and key mode. 

This tool needs an active internet connection as third party libraries used are hosted in cdn.

Known issues:
* Empty objects are shown if the JSONS are equal.
* In case of arrays only check for array length and not values.
